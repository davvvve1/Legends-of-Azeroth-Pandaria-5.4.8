-- Boss Bot Callers are public neutral coordinators, not quest-phased actors.
-- GM mode temporarily gives a player PHASEMASK_ANYWHERE, which previously hid
-- this defect: every caller had phaseMask=1 and could disappear again after
-- `.gm off` restored the character's real phase mask.
--
-- Limit the update to caller spawns that also have an explicit coordinator
-- configuration. The gossip script still requires its configured world boss to
-- be alive nearby before it permits Preview or Call, so cross-phase visibility
-- cannot start a raid against a missing boss.
