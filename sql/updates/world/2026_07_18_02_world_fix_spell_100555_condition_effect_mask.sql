-- Build-18414 SpellEffect.dbc defines spell 100555 effect 0 with a non-area
-- caster target and effect 1 with TARGET_DEST_NEARBY_ENTRY. SourceGroup is an
-- effect bitmask, so 3 incorrectly applies this entry condition to effect 0.
-- Keep the condition and restrict it to the intended effect 1 with mask 2.
